## The Building Blocks

Special thanks go out to the following tools and services:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - The definitive static file blogging framework
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - websites for you and your projects

Many open-source libraries made this work possible. Special thanks go out to the following NPM modules:

- base64 - a base64 encoder / decoder, compatible with atob() and btoa()
- Blob - W3C Blob interface for browsers that do not support it
- Bootstrap - a framework for faster and easier web development
- crypto-js - an implementation of SHA256 and MD5 hashing
- FileSaver - W3C FileSaver interface for browsers that do not support it
- json2 - JSON feature for browsers that do not support it
- jszip - create, read, and edit .zip files with Javascript
- libgif.js - a modified version of @buzzfeed's & @shachaf's GIF parser
- libgifparser.js - my lib, based on @buzzfeed's SuperGIF
- object-keys.js - Object.keys for browsers that do not support it
- string-helpers.js - contains, endsWith, ... for browsers without support
- UUID - a JavaScript module to create GUIDs
- MaxRectsBinPack.cpp - my JavaScript port of C++ source by Jukka JylÃ¤nki

Having to write all that supporting code would have killed the project before it started. There's only so much time tucked away into the evenings and weekends.
