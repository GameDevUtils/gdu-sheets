title: "GameDevUtils.com Reboot"
---

November 19th, 2016, marks the last significant edit to the [GameDevUtils.com](http://gamedevutils.com/) site if you don't count September 20th, 2020, when a hotfix was posted for a breaking change in GitHub Pages. Either way you view it, too much time has passed with no updates.

## Now, Reboot

The existing sprite packer is being given a complete makeover. The new web app is being written using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). As far as features go, the new app will be a one-to-one match for the current app. So, you get the same features you know and love (like importing animations from GIFs).

## Soon, 3x the Awesome

As the new web app is being developed, the same core code is being used to build a cross-platform desktop app for offline editing, and a cross-platform command line app that enables CI/CD pipelines.

- Static Web App (using [React](https://reactjs.org/))
- Desktop App (using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/))
- Command Line App (Using [Node](https://nodejs.org/))

## Then, Even More Awesome

All that innovation doesn't end with the first app (sprite sheets). The plan is to create three apps (static web, desktop, and command line) for each module in the project roadmap. Of course, this will be done according to each app's feasibility for each platform. For example, it may not make sense to write a command line app for the tile editor.

Thanks for reading this far and for having an interest in the project. If you have suggestions for new apps or new features for any of the apps in the roadmap, [open a new issue for us to review](https://github.com/GameDevUtils/gdu-sheets/issues/new?title=Suggestion&body={Describe your new feature or app here.})!
