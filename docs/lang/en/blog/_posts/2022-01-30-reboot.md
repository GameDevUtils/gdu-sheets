November 19th, 2016, marks the last significant edit to the [GameDevUtils.com](http://gamedevutils.com/) site if you don't count September 20th, 2020, when a hotfix was posted for a breaking change in GitHub Pages. Either way you view it, too much time has passed with no updates.

## Now, Reboot

The existing sprite packer is being given a complete makeover. The new web app is being written using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). As far as features go, the new app will be a one-to-one match for the current app. So, you get the same features you know and love (like importing animations from GIFs).

## Soon, 3x the Awesome

As the new web app is being developed, the same core code is being used to build a cross-platform desktop app for offline editing, and a cross-platform command line app that enables CI/CD pipelines.

- Static Web App (using [React](https://reactjs.org/))
- Desktop App (using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/))
- Command Line App (Using [Node](https://nodejs.org/))
