title: "Happy Birth Day, Eldest!"
---

On February 13th, 2022, my firstborn (of three girls) turned 22!

The time passes so quickly. That cute little toddler of mine is married now, and could conceivably have her own toddler in the next few years. I'm not sure about being labeled a grandfather, but I look forward to the experience.

So, I just wanted to wish a happy birthday to my eldest. You've changed me so much for the better, and fulfilled dreams I never even knew I had.
