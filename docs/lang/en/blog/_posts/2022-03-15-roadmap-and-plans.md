title: "GameDevUtils.com Roadmap Plans"

All the previously mentioned innovation doesn't end with the first app (sprite sheets). The plan is to create three apps (static web, desktop, and command line) for each module in the project roadmap. Of course, this will be done according to each app's feasibility for each platform. For example, it may not make sense to write a command line app for the tile editor.
